# webnite
Webnite is an awesome command-line tool for automating workable structures for websites using frameworks such as foundation, bootstrap and more! Designers can define paremeters that they would like to carry across their project and webnite will automatically structure the selected framework so they can focus on what matters most: the design itself.
