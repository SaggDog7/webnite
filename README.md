### This project is in very early development. The current state in no way reflects the intended final product as of yet.

Webnite is an awesome command-line tool for automating workable structures for websites using frameworks such as Foundation, Bootstrap and more! Designers can define paremeters that they would like to carry across their project and webnite will automatically structure the selected framework so they can focus on what matters most.

##### Example usage:
```python3 webnite.py MySite -f```

Generates a new site called "MySite" using the Foundation framework.
